    "# **Identifying differentially expressed genes involved in Tetralogy of Fallot**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is a congenital heart defect that affects the structure of the heart and its ability to pump blood to the body (1). TOF is one of the most common forms of congenital heart disease, accounting for around 10% of all cases (2). The condition is characterized by a combination of four abnormalities in the heart: a ventricular septal defect (VSD), narrowing of the pulmonary artery (pulmonary stenosis), an enlarged aorta that overrides the VSD, and right ventricular hypertrophy (thickening of the muscle in the right ventricle) (3). These abnormalities can cause oxygen-poor blood to be pumped to the body, resulting in symptoms such as cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin), shortness of breath, and fatigue. While TOF is a serious condition, advances in medical treatment have greatly improved the long-term outlook for those born with the defect (4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Locating differentially expressed genes can provide valuable insights into the underlying biological mechanisms of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and help identify potential therapeutic targets. Differentially expressed genes are genes that are expressed at different levels between affected individuals and healthy controls. These genes can be identified using techniques such as microarray analysis or RNA sequencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's assignment we will use a dataset from the EMBL-EBI's Expression Atlas to locate differentially expressed genes for TOF (5, 6). You will visualize your results with a volcano plot. Let's get started!"
